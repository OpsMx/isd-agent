This file contains samples that can be used for configuring accounts and artifacts in the agent.

Steps for Configuring Kuberenets accounts:
1. create a git-repo and a username+token to access it
2. create a kubeconfig file to access the namespaces. The kubeconfig must be static kubeconfig and the one generated by a cloud command such as gcloud.
   Instructions for generating a static kubeconfig can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11TlDGyPVlLMbuXSDSMdTCc-wamSvDY-UnHiN2x7f0B8/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Edit the clouddriver-local.yml as appropriate (see comments in the file)
4. Push both files (clouddriver-local.yml and the kubeconfig) to the git-repo
5. Configure "dynamicAccounts" in values.yaml by providing the repo-access information
